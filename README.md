# 📱 BlueMark – Bluetooth-Based Attendance Management System

Managing attendance in educational institutions is still largely a manual process, which often leads to inefficiencies, human errors, paperwork burden, difficulty in maintaining past records, and lack of instant access to attendance data.

**BlueMark** is an Android-based attendance management application designed to overcome these challenges by enabling teachers or administrators to mark attendance of all students present in a classroom or designated area with a **single tap using Bluetooth technology**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

BlueMark modernizes the traditional attendance system by using **Bluetooth-based proximity detection** along with **GPS validation** to automatically mark student attendance.  
The system eliminates manual roll calls and provides a **contactless, real-time, and reliable attendance solution** for educational institutions.

Teachers can start an attendance session, and nearby student devices are detected automatically, ensuring fast and accurate attendance marking.
